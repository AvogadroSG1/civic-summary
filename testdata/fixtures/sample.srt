00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good evening everyone, welcome to the regular session
of the Hagerstown City Council.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Tonight we have several items on our agenda
including the community development grant.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Before we begin, I'd like to recognize
our city employees for their service.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll now open the floor for citizen comments.
Please state your name for the record.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you Mayor. My name is John Smith
and I'd like to address the council about
traffic concerns on Dual Highway.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The intersection at Dual Highway and Eastern Boulevard
has become increasingly dangerous. We need a traffic study
to evaluate potential improvements.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you Mr. Smith. Next we have Jane Doe.
Thank you. I want to commend the parks department
for the excellent maintenance of our city parks.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Moving on to action items. The first item is the
community development grant application for fifty
thousand dollars for neighborhood improvements.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I move to approve the grant application.
Second. All in favor? Motion carries five to zero.
Let the record show the grant is approved.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Next item is the first reading of Ordinance 25-01
regarding updated parking regulations in the
downtown district.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The ordinance would modify parking meter hours
and introduce a new residential parking permit
program for downtown residents.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Staff is requesting council guidance on budget
priorities for fiscal year 2026. We need direction
on capital improvement prioritization.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now for our major discussion item. The proposed
ten million dollar infrastructure bond would fund
critical road and bridge repairs throughout the city.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This bond would address deferred maintenance on
approximately thirty miles of city roads and
twelve bridges that need structural repairs.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The estimated annual debt service would be
approximately eight hundred thousand dollars
funded through existing property tax revenue.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Council members expressed support for the concept
but requested additional analysis of the impact
on the city's bond rating and debt capacity.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Our second major discussion topic is the affordable
housing initiative. Staff is proposing new requirements
for developers building more than twenty units.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The proposal would require ten percent of units
to be designated as affordable at eighty percent
of area median income.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Several council members raised concerns about
the impact on development costs and whether this
could discourage new construction.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In conclusion, the next regular session is scheduled
for February 18, 2025. Thank you all for attending.
This meeting is adjourned.
