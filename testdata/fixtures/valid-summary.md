## 1. Updates

### Community Events **[00:01:00-00:05:00]**
The Mayor announced upcoming community events including the annual Spring Festival scheduled for April 12-14 in City Park. The festival will feature live music, food vendors from local restaurants, craft exhibitions, and a children's activity area. Registration for vendor booths is now open through the city's website. The Mayor encouraged all residents to participate and noted that last year's event attracted over 5,000 attendees from across Washington County.

### Staff Reports **[00:05:00-00:15:00]**
City Manager Robert Wilson provided comprehensive updates on ongoing infrastructure projects across the city. The East End water main replacement project is currently 75% complete, with an expected completion date of March 15, 2025. The project has remained within the approved budget of $2.3 million. Additionally, the repaving of South Potomac Street is scheduled to begin in early March, pending favorable weather conditions. The city's code enforcement division reported a 15% increase in property maintenance compliance over the past quarter, attributing the improvement to the new community outreach program implemented in October 2024.

### Proclamations **[00:15:00-00:20:00]**
The Mayor issued a proclamation declaring February 2025 as Black History Month in Hagerstown, highlighting the contributions of African American community members throughout the city's history. Council members expressed their support and encouraged residents to attend the planned educational events at the Washington County Free Library throughout the month.

## 2. Citizen Comments

### John Smith **[00:20:00-00:25:00]**
Mr. Smith, a resident of the Dual Highway corridor, expressed significant concerns about increasing traffic congestion and safety hazards at the intersection of Dual Highway and Eastern Boulevard. He cited three accidents in the past month at that location and requested the council consider commissioning a traffic study. He also suggested the installation of additional street lighting along the quarter-mile stretch between Wesel Boulevard and Eastern Boulevard, noting that pedestrian visibility is severely limited during evening hours.

### Jane Doe **[00:25:00-00:28:00]**
Ms. Doe praised the city's parks maintenance efforts, particularly the recent improvements to Fairgrounds Park. She noted the new walking trail surface, upgraded playground equipment, and improved landscaping. She thanked the parks department staff by name, recognizing their dedication during the challenging winter months. She also suggested that the city consider adding a dog park area to one of the existing municipal parks.

### Michael Brown **[00:28:00-00:32:00]**
Mr. Brown, representing the Downtown Business Alliance, addressed the council regarding parking availability in the downtown district. He presented data showing that downtown businesses have experienced a 12% decrease in foot traffic over the past six months, which he attributed in part to limited parking options. He urged the council to explore creative parking solutions, including potential partnerships with private lot owners for evening and weekend use.

## 3. Actions Taken

### Grant Approval **[00:35:00-00:40:00]**
Council unanimously approved a $50,000 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) application for neighborhood infrastructure improvements in the Jonathan Street corridor. The grant will fund sidewalk repairs, ADA-compliant curb cuts, and improved drainage systems. The project is expected to benefit approximately 200 households in the targeted area. Vote: 5-0.

### Ordinance Reading **[00:40:00-00:48:00]**
First reading of Ordinance 25-01 was conducted, proposing updated parking regulations for the downtown district. Key provisions include extending meter hours from 6 PM to 8 PM on weekdays, implementing a new residential parking permit program for downtown residents at $25 annually, and establishing a two-hour maximum parking limit in the core commercial zone. A public hearing on this ordinance is scheduled for the February 18, 2025 meeting. No vote was taken; this was an informational reading only.

### Contract Award **[00:48:00-00:52:00]**
Council approved a three-year contract with CleanCity Services for municipal building janitorial services at a total cost of $384,000 ($128,000 annually). The contract includes a performance review clause at the 18-month mark. This represents a 6% increase over the previous contract but includes expanded services for the newly renovated Community Center. Vote: 4-1, with Council Member Davis voting against, citing a preference for bringing the service in-house.

## 4. Input Requested from Council

### Budget Priorities **[00:55:00-01:05:00]**
Finance Director Sarah Chen presented preliminary budget projections for FY2026 and requested council guidance on capital improvement prioritization. The city faces an estimated $4.2 million gap between identified capital needs and available funding. Staff presented three priority scenarios for council consideration, ranging from infrastructure-focused to community services-focused allocations. Council members requested additional analysis comparing the long-term cost implications of deferring road maintenance versus investing now, with findings to be presented at the next work session.

## 5. Critical Discussions

### Infrastructure Bond Proposal **[01:10:00-01:35:00]**
Council engaged in extensive discussion regarding a proposed $10 million general obligation bond for infrastructure improvements. City Engineer James Martinez presented a detailed assessment showing that 23 miles of city roads are currently rated "poor" or "failing," and 12 bridges require structural repairs within the next five years. The estimated cost of addressing all identified deficiencies is $14.5 million, making the $10 million bond a strategic first phase. The annual debt service would be approximately $800,000, which staff indicated could be absorbed within existing property tax revenue without a rate increase, assuming continued growth in the tax base at historical rates of 2.5% annually.

Council members raised several important questions: the impact on the city's existing bond rating (currently AA-), the prioritization methodology for selecting which roads and bridges to address first, and whether the bond could include provisions for green infrastructure improvements. Staff was directed to prepare a detailed project list with cost estimates for the March work session.

**Why this matters:** This bond would fund critical road and bridge repairs affecting daily commutes for thousands of Hagerstown residents. The condition of city infrastructure directly impacts property values, public safety, and economic development potential. Deferring these repairs would increase costs by an estimated 7-10% annually due to accelerating deterioration.

### Affordable Housing Initiative **[01:35:00-01:55:00]**
Planning Director Maria Gonzalez presented a draft affordable housing policy for council discussion. The proposal would require developers of residential projects with 20 or more units to designate 10% of units as affordable, defined as rental rates at or below 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI). Developers would have the option of paying an in-lieu fee of $25,000 per required affordable unit into the city's Housing Trust Fund as an alternative to on-site construction.

Several council members expressed support for the goal but raised concerns about implementation. Council Member Johnson noted that surrounding jurisdictions do not have similar requirements, potentially creating a competitive disadvantage for Hagerstown in attracting development. Council Member Garcia countered that the city's relatively lower land costs and available tax incentives provide sufficient offset. The planning director was asked to conduct an economic impact analysis and to survey comparable programs in Maryland municipalities for the next meeting.

**Why this matters:** Housing affordability is a growing concern for Hagerstown residents, with recent data showing that 38% of renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. This policy could create new affordable housing units but needs careful calibration to avoid discouraging the new construction the city needs.

## Conclusion

The council took decisive action on the community development grant and janitorial services contract, while advancing important discussions on infrastructure investment and housing policy. The infrastructure bond proposal and affordable housing initiative will continue through the public input process in coming weeks. The next regular session is scheduled for February 18, 2025, which will include the public hearing on Ordinance 25-01 regarding downtown parking regulations.
