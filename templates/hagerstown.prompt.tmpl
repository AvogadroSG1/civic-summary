**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:

1. **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Start your response with exactly "---" (the YAML frontmatter opener). Do not include ANY text before this. No "Here is", no "I'll create", no explanations. JUST the markdown document.

3. **Timestamps**: Include timestamps in format **[HH:MM:SS-HH:MM:SS]** or **[HH:MM:SS]** for ALL major topics.

4. **Audience**: Write for general citizens, not government insiders. Explain jargon and acronyms.

5. **Accuracy**: Use exact dollar amounts, dates, proper names, and vote counts from the transcript.

6. **Analysis**: In "Critical Discussions" provide citizen-focused analysis explaining "why this matters."

7. **Structure**: Follow the exact markdown format shown above. Maintain consistent heading levels.
